📊 Project Overview — “Codeforces Analyzer”
Your project is a Streamlit web app that lets any Codeforces user:

Analyze their contest performance — visualize rating changes, best/worst ranks, rating history.

Deep-dive into problems solved & attempted — see stats like solved vs unsolved distribution, tags, difficulty levels.

View contest-wise breakdowns — what problems they solved during contests, rating deltas per contest.

Get personalized problem recommendations — find unsolved problems that match their weak areas (tags where they solved the fewest problems) and within a suitable rating range.
